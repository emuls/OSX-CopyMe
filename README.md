# OSX-CopyMe

A simple project for copying text to your clipboard.  It will copy configured text into your keyboard.  You can set what text you want to be copied when you click the copy button.  Clicking the application icon in your dock will also copy the text to your clipboard.

###TODO
Don't store copy value in keychain, store it in a location that does not need permission to access (less annoying)
